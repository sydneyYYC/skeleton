The Orange by Wendy Cope 

The Orange

At lunchtime I bought a huge orange—
The size of it made us all laugh.
I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave—
They got quarters and I had a half.

And that orange, it made me so happy,
As ordinary things often do
Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.
This is peace and contentment. It’s new.

The rest of the day was quite easy.
I did all the jobs on my list
And enjoyed them and had some time over.
I love you. I’m glad I exist.

Among the Orange Groves by Lissa Miller 
wherever i am the stars are
and the stars dissolve, resistant
perfume of a dizzy mood, shadows
can’t keep still beneath the trees
nobody misses the past, its dark and
darker green, its flocks of crows
by a dry riverbed, the crows settle
the crows leave trinkets in the leaves, the weight
of citrus comes and goes, the river fills with light
the trees are trimmed to round
and stars are blossom shaped,
sometimes the oranges hang so low, i know
no other sun would drop like that, no sun would bother
to varnish the oranges
